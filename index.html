                    I've been licensed since 2003 and have worked at several
                    different brokerage firms in multiple capacities. Being a
                    part of The Real Solution Network was a complete game
                    changer for me and my career. I've learned SO much that I
                    didn't know about being successful both in real estate and
                    my personal life and habits. My income has never been
                    higher. In previous brokerage, agents were competitive,
                    fighting for every lead, every deal, and every dollar. Here
                    we are cooperative and we celebrate each other's successes
                    and encourage one another, help each other solve challenges.
                    I have never worked in any environment that is this
                    supportive and focused on the success of everyone on the
                    team.

                    I have been in the Real Estate Field since 1995 and got my
                    license in 1999. I have been with many Brokerages but the
                    best move I have made in my career is when I joined The Chad
                    Smith Team and The Real Solution. The Real Estate World is
                    ever changing with new challenges daily. Within The Real
                    Solution Network we are always given support and words of
                    encouragement. The Network has a Biblical Foundation so it
                    is a Blessing to be working with like minded people who are
                    making a difference in peopleâ€™s lives and continue to put
                    God and His Truth first.
